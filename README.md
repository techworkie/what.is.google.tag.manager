# What is Google tag Manager?

Google Tag Manager is a free tag management system that allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code or tracking pixels) on your website (or mobile app) without having to modify the code.

Here’s a very simple example of how Google Tag Manager works. Information from one data source (your website) is shared with another data source (Google Analytics) through Google Tag Manager. GTM becomes very handy when you have lots of tags to manage because all of the code is stored in one place.     



## Is Google Tag Manager easy to use?

They say it’s a “simple” tool that any marketer can use without needing a web developer.

* I may get run over in the comments section for saying this, but I’m standing my ground. Google Tag Manager is not “easy” to use without some technical knowledge or training (courses or self-taught).

* You have to have some technical knowledge to understand how to set up tags, triggers and variables. If you’re dropping in Facebook pixels, you’ll need some understanding of how Facebook tracking pixels work.

* If you want to set up event tracking in Google Tag Manager, you’ll need some knowledge about what “events” are, how Google Analytics works, what data you can track with events, what the reports look like in Google Analytics and how to name your categories, actions and labels.

* Although it is “easy” to manage multiple tags in GTM, there is a learning curve. Once you’re over the hump, GTM is pretty slick about what you can track.


## What are tags?

Tags are snippets of code or tracking pixels from third-party tools. These tags tell Google Tag Manager what to do.

**Examples of common tags within Google Tag Manager are:**

* Google Analytics Universal tracking code or GA4 tracking code
* Adwords Remarketing code
* Adwords Conversion Tracking code
* Heatmap tracking code (Hotjar, CrazyEgg, etc…)
* Facebook pixels
* Custom HTML scripts
* Cookiebot and other GDPR data privacy scripts
